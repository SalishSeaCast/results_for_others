The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for model results time series
assembly and analysis for investigation of density signal correlation at
Boundary Pass and the ONC SoG Central node.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[BoundaryPassCentralNodeResultsTimeSeries.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/results/raw/tip/BoundaryPassCentralNodeForRich/BoundaryPassCentralNodeResultsTimeSeries.ipynb)  
    
    **Boundary Pass and ONC Central Node Results Time Series**  
      
    Assemble time series results for Rich:  
      
    * NEMO-3.6 nowcast-green runs  
    * full water column  
    * hourly average results at Boundary Pass location of ONC mooring  
    * hourly average results at ONC central node  
    * 1-Jun-2016 through 30-Sep-2016  
      
    After the planned NEMO-3.6 hindcast runs it should be possible to increase the time resolution  
    to 10 minute averages.
